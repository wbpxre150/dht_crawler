# Active DHT Maintenance (Critical for peer discovery)
# These settings keep the node active in the DHT network
# CONSERVATIVE DEFAULTS: Prevents routing table churn during bootstrap
# NOTE: Active maintenance is DISABLED until 100+ good nodes (prevents eviction churn)
bucket_refresh_interval_sec=90
neighbourhood_refresh_interval_sec=60    # Every 60s (reduced from aggressive 15s)
wandering_search_interval_sec=30         # Every 30s (reduced from aggressive 5s)
wandering_searches_per_cycle=3           # 3 per cycle (reduced from aggressive 20)
max_concurrent_searches=15               # 15 concurrent (reduced from aggressive 100)

# CRITICAL mode activates when good < 10 nodes (emergency bootstrap)

# ==== PHASE 3: Active Network Exploration ====
# Improves DHT network coverage through active queries
# MODERATE MODE: Balanced node discovery (reduced from aggressive to prevent routing table flooding)
exploration_enabled=1
target_rotation_interval=10
find_node_rate=10                        # 10 queries/sec (was 50) - moderate discovery
find_node_workers=50                     # 50 concurrent workers (was 300) - reasonable parallelism
discovered_queue_capacity=50000          # 50K queue (scaled with routing table) - large buffer for node discovery
bootstrap_reseed_interval_sec=300        # Every 5 min (was 120) when unhealthy

# ==== PHASE 4: Worker Pool Settings ====
# Increases concurrent metadata fetching for 10-20x throughput

# Improves write performance by 10-100x through transaction batching

shadow_table_persist=1

# ==== PHASE 7: Active Ping Verification (BUGFIX) ====
# DISABLED: jech/dht library already handles node verification automatically
# Manual pinging interferes with jech/dht's internal node management

# Meta Data Fetcher
# Maximum concurrent TCP connections per info_hash
# OPTIMIZED: Reduced from 20 to 10 to avoid overwhelming peers
# With sequential peer fallback, we now try ALL available peers until success
# Lower concurrent value per hash allows better global connection distribution
concurrent_peers_per_torrent = 10

# Maximum concurrent TCP connections globally (across all infohashes)
# AGGRESSIVE: High limit to maximize throughput across all torrents
max_concurrent_connections = 2000

# Connection timeout in seconds
# OPTIMIZED: Reduced from 6s to 4s to fail faster and try next peer
# Faster timeouts mean quicker peer rotation and better success rates
connection_timeout_sec = 4

# Maximum metadata size in MB (reject larger)
max_metadata_size_mb = 100

# Retry failed metadata fetches (0=disabled, 1=enabled)
# DISABLED: With sequential peer fallback, we exhaust all peers on first attempt
# No need to retry since we already tried all available peers

# ==== wbpxre-dht Settings ====

# Maximum nodes in routing table (default: 10000)
# Higher values improve DHT coverage but use more memory (~200 bytes per node)
# OPTIMIZED: 40000 nodes leaves headroom for rotation (80% = 32K triggers eviction)
# 40000 nodes ≈ 8 MB memory
# NOTE: The maintenance thread automatically pings and removes stale nodes
max_routing_table_nodes=50000

# ==== Node Health and Pruning Settings ====
# Aggressive node health tracking and pruning to maintain a fresh routing table
# Prevents metadata fetch rate drops when routing table reaches capacity
# TUNED FOR HOT ROTATION: Settings optimized for keyspace rotation strategy
max_node_age_sec=120                      # Consider nodes old after 2 minutes (more realistic)
node_verification_batch_size=3000         # Verify up to 3000 old nodes per cycle (every 5s, increased for faster cycling)
node_cleanup_interval_sec=10              # Clean dropped nodes every 10 seconds (faster cleanup)
min_node_response_rate=0.25               # Evict nodes with <25% response rate (more lenient to keep good nodes)
node_quality_min_queries=3                # Need only 3 queries before judging quality (faster eviction)

# ==== Node ID Rotation Settings ====
# Periodically change node ID to explore different DHT keyspace regions
# This increases metadata discovery by moving to different parts of the network
# HOT ROTATION MODE: Preserves routing table and keeps workers running (NO DOWNTIME!)
# - Eliminates ~120 second bootstrap penalty per rotation
# - Maintains 6,500+ routing table nodes across rotations
# - Three-phase transition: STABLE -> ANNOUNCING (30s) -> TRANSITIONING (30s) -> STABLE
# - Expected 3-4x improvement in discovery rate vs destructive rotation
node_rotation_enabled=1
node_rotation_interval_sec=90        # Rotate every 160 seconds
